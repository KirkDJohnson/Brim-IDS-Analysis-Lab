<h1>Brim IDS/Packet Analysis Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this lab, I received a Linux VM equipped with packet capture analysis tools to address an alert regarding the detection of a Network Trojan. Upon opening the packet capture (.pcap) in Brim for optimal data visibility, I observed alerts generated by Suricata, functioning as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The alert "A Network Trojan was Detected" served as the starting point for my investigation. I filtered for the source IP that triggered the alert and identified two downloaded files: one in .exe or .dll format and another unrecognized by previous alerts. Further filtering for the IP associated with the alerts revealed a suspicious HTTP "GET" request, resulting in the download of a file named gap1[.]cab from a domain comprised of random characters, indicative of potential malicious activity. Upon researching the domain, it was widely flagged as malicious on VirusTotal. Upon confirming the domain's malicious nature, I transitioned to Wireshark, extracting the downloaded file from the host to the VM and obtaining its SHA256 hash. A VirusTotal search using the hash confirmed the file as Valak malware, an information stealer. Lastly, I investigated additional alerts to determine if the host communicated with other malicious hosts. Upon examining the "Not Suspicious Traffic" alerts, I discovered that both IPs were associated with cloud-hosted servers linked to malicious files and passive DNS replication.

Scenario for the lab.<br/>

<br />
<br />
With the tools provided in the lab I chose to first use Brim as it has the most enriched data compared to Wireshark and Network Miner.<br/>

<br />
<br />
See that there are Suricata IDS logs, I filtered to see what alerts where generated. The alert "Misc activity, A network Trojan was detected, Potential Corporate..." I first investigated.<br/>

<br />
<br />
Filtering for the source IP that triggered the alert, it shows three alerts. I first examined the alert generated from downloading an "non-executable" from the internet which is often used for mawlare to disguise a malicious file.<br/>

<br />
<br />
Doubling clicking on the first alert provides further details that revealed the alert signature was generated from MSXMLHTTP which is a component used for making HTTP requests which which I will note for later.<br/>

<br />
<br />
However, the third alert that was generated had the signature "ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP", which indicates a different file extension than the previous alert. <br/>

<br />
<br />
When filtering for just the malicious IP, more packets are shown, one of which is an HTTP "GET" request packet to a suspicious domain, "awh93dhkylps5ulnq-be[.]com/czwih/fxla[.]php?l=gap1.cab"<br/>

<br />
<br />
Searching for suspicious domain from the GET request on VirusTotal shows that it is indeed malicious tied to phishing/malware. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Switching over to Wireshark, I went to export -> HTTP and searched for the domain used in the GET request and saved/downloaded the file.<br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the file was exported to the VM, I used the terminal with the command sha256sum on the file to get the file hash for further analysis.<br/>

<br />
<br />
With the hash of the file I uploaded it to VirusTotal and discovered the gap1[.]cab was acuatlly draw.dll a trojan known as "Valak".<br/>

<br />
<br />
After confirming the host had connection with a malicious domian I filtered for other domains the host reached out to that may also have been malicious through Brim and Wireshark.<br/>

<br />
<br />
I conducted further research on the two domains I found in Wireshark and Brim and found <br/>

<br />
<br />
Lastly for this investigation, when I first examined the Suricata logs in Brim there were two alerts for "Not Suspicoius Traffic" from different IPs than the primarly attacker, but considering the host is compromised with a Trojan it is worth investigating all traffic for further Indicators of Attack.<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/KirkDJohnson/Malicious-Download-Analysis-with-Brim-Lab/assets/164972007/94a1a5b4-985e-4e25-a268-d5152db72b02"  alt="Brim Analysis"/>
<br />
<br />
The first IP I examined was 64[.]225[.]65[.]166, when uploaded to VirusTotal it has a 0/90 community score, however when it is a DigitalOcean domain meaning it is hosted in the cloud. This is a very cheap and easy way to create and delete servers. More importantly, in the Relations tab, it hass Passive DNS replication and Communicating files with clearly malicious entities signifying this IP to be malicious and part of the attack.<br/>

<br />
<br />
The second IP had a bit more evidence, VirusTotal did have a labled as malicious, however, filtering for the IP on Brim shows a DNS query to 2partscow[.]top. Searching for that domain in VirusTotal also shows that is malicous with relations to futher malicious domains and files.<br/>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
The lab/CTF presented a fairly straightforward scenario, providing practice uncovering Inidcators of Compromise and Attack using various tools. Since this was my first encounter with Brim, I had to familiarize myself with its syntax for filtering, which differs from Wireshark, a tool I'm more accustomed to. Nonetheless, the lab offered valuable hands-on experience in understanding how Suricata logs and alerts function within Brim, filtering logs effectively, and integrating evidence from Brim into Wireshark for a different perspective. In my case, I utilized Wireshark to export a specific file for hashing, a process I was more comfortable with, although it may have been possible in Brim. Moreover, the lab taught me a valuable lesson on the importance of not disregarding traffic labeled as "Not Suspicious" by the IDS, as investigation revealed associations with suspicious domains.
